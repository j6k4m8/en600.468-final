<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Moses currently functions as a standalone process, and while it runs on a server — capable of accepting requests via HTTP request — it does not prioritize serving a public-facing API (namely, a JSON interface for RESTful calls). This project aims to rectify this deficit, not only adding a JSON endpoint framework to Moses, but also implementing standalone projects that utilize this framework to bring machine translation (via Moses) to (1) website translation on-page; (2) realtime voice &#39;chat&#39; across language barriers.</p>
<h2 id="prior-work">Prior Work</h2>
<p>Moses supports on-demand web-translation using a page-download functionality, available at <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.WebTranslation">this link</a>. However, this functionality is largely reserved for those familiar with the Moses software: In the words of this project page, this system&#39;s target audience looks for those requesting &quot;a proof-of-concept type of demonstration&quot;.</p>
<p>This project aims to incorporate this style of translation into a realtime Chrome extension that functions similarly to the existing Google Translate extension script <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=en">available here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, this project aims to illustrate alternative uses of this same API interface by supporting the development of a Moses-based realtime speech translation platform, a la <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/2014/12/15/skype-translator-how-it-works/">Skype&#39;s translation system</a>.</p>
<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>This project aims to provide a public-facing API interface for a Moses server to improve accessibility of this platform to non-programmers or non-developers. As a proof-of-concept, I intend to develop web-friendly (i.e. user-friendly) apps that utilize this API, enabling such services as realtime speech translation (via speech-recognition API), according to the proposed project on the Moses suggested-projects &quot;Get Involved&quot; page <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.GetInvolved">here</a>. This system will use a standalone Moses server as described in <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Advanced.Moses#ntoc1">the documentation</a> to serve as a backend, while simple, low-overhead webpages will serve as the user-facing portal.</p>
<p>This serves to bring Moses translation to the forefront of usability in translation engines, rather than existing solely in researcher- or developer-usable spaces.</p>
<h2 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h2>
<p>This project will focus on making the public-facing API more robust, while also developing a front-end (JavaScript) library to improve ease of development with the Moses machine translation engine. Current API specs already exist — a la the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/v2/using_rest">Google Translate API</a> — which can be extended to promote Moses-specific functionality. This project will focus on improving asynchronous API calls for the Moses service, without sacrificing efficacy.</p>
<p>I predict that this project will involve both C++ (Moses-native) and Node (JS) development, and will span both web-development and machine-translation-specific design challenges.</p>
