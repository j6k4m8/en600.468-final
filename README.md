Goshen: A JavaScript library for interfacing with Moses Machine Translation servers.

Google Translate exposes a comprehensive REST API â€” and so does Moses (via moses-mt-server). But this API is less-used by the casual developer, due to the lack of a developer-friendly frontend library. This project provides a well-documented JavaScript library to interface with arbitrary machine translation backends, with an emphasis on Moses.
